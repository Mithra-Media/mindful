# Mindful: a VR meditation experience
The purpose of Mindful is to create an immersive experience using virtual reality to practice mindfulness habits. The use of virtual reality allows for the user to be present in a calming environment, free of outside factors. The application also guides the user through different meditation techniques, and will be an effective tool to educate users on mindfulness and meditation practices.

## Overview
In addition to the primary purpose of providing a mindful environment in virtual reality, a major purpose of the application is to educate users on meditation and mindfulness practices that can be applied in everyday life. Through the application, users will be guided through meditation, including practicing correct posture, and learn different well-known techniques.

## Platform
The application is targeted at VR platforms, such as Google Cardboard and the Oculus Rift. To make Mindful a more accessible application, the project should be runnable on a Google Cardboard using WebVR at the minimum with no issues.

## Tools
The project will be primarily implemented using Unity. Sketch, a user interface tool, will be used to plan the visual design of the application. Most of the model assets will be obtained from [Google Poly](https://poly.google.com/). Other assets will be required, such as sound and possibly voice-over audio. Attributions for these will be made available as assets are obtained, where applicable.
